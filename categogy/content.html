  <h2>Soccer Random: A Fun and Chaotic Pixel Soccer Game</h2>

<p><strong>Soccer Random</strong> is a fun and chaotic sports game usually designed for two players. Developed by <em>MGM Interactive Studio</em>, this football game features pixel graphics and was released as an HTML5 game in February 2020, with an Android version available from March 2020. Inspired by games like <em>Rooftop Snipers</em> and <em>Getaway Shootout</em>, the objective is to score 5 goals and win—even if balls, players, or goals randomly change.</p>

<h3>The Basic Concept</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Randomness in everything.</strong> The main feature of the game is unpredictability. All elements, from ball physics to player abilities and match conditions, change randomly, creating fun and unpredictable gameplay.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple operation.</strong> Controls are simple—usually one button per player to make them jump. Easy to learn, but predicting the next event is challenging.</li>
  <li><strong>The goal of the game.</strong> Score more goals than your opponent before time runs out or before reaching the goal target.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Main Features and Elements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Random fields.</strong> Matches take place on different football fields with unique features like slippery ice, beaches with altered gravity, or fields with trampolines.</li>
  <li><strong>Different players.</strong> Each game features different soccer players, often with funny characteristics such as huge heads, long legs, or even dinosaurs playing soccer.</li>
  <li><strong>Random balls.</strong> Ball sizes and physics vary—sometimes a huge heavy ball, other times a bouncy, hard-to-control one.</li>
  <li><strong>Different conditions.</strong> Weather and random events affect gameplay, like rain making the field slippery or bonuses appearing to provide advantages.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Game Modes</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Two-player mode.</strong> The most popular mode where two players compete on the same screen.</li>
  <li><strong>Single player mode.</strong> Play against the computer with adjustable difficulty.</li>
  <li><strong>Tournament mode.</strong> Some versions allow competing in a tournament against multiple opponents.</li>
</ul>
